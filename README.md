### What I did

I spent my hack-a-thing time learning GraphQL. My API experience primarily comes from building RESTful APIs in cs52, so this seemed like a logical next step 

### How I did it

I followed two tutorials to build a client that interacts with an API that uses GraphQL and a GraphQL server.

### What worked?
