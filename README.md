# Hack-a-thing 1
## Joseph Notis, Fall 2020

### What I did

I spent my hack-a-thing time learning GraphQL. My API experience primarily comes from building RESTful APIs in cs52, so this seemed like a logical next step. I was interested in GraphQL because of its flexibility, especially in querying. While a RESTful API has a route for each accessible piece of data, GraphQL allows developers to select the exact pieces of data they need.

### Who did it?

I worked alone on this hack-a-thing

### How I did it

I followed two tutorials to build a client that interacts with an API that uses GraphQL and a GraphQL server itself.

### What worked?

The tutorials were well-built and easy to follow. I was able to understand what code I was writing. 

### What was tough/didn't work?

Looking back at what I completed, I wish I completed the "GraphQL using Node" tutorial first. This would have given me a stronger foundation to what was going on when editing the frontend rather than just trusting the provided server code.
